# API Sketch. 

Introduction

The aim of this assessment was to showcase an understanding of the concepts introduced in modules 1 and 2 of this unit. Students were to demonstrate this understanding by creating web application that displays data gained from a web-based Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum (GLAM) API. 

Ideation

Before creating the web application, I firstly researched GLAM API’s. This was to see the content of the data that each one presented, as this would help my ideation of my web application and its purpose. 

Through a process of elimination, I decided to use the National Museum of Australia’s (NMA) API, as it had a wide variety of data types that I could present. 

While looking through the NMA’s collection API explorer, I found that jewellery and subcategories of jewellery returned a large amount of search results. This informed my decision to create my web application around jewellery collections. The target audience for this web application are individuals for are interested in jewellery design. 

Process 

Firstly, I followed the order to create a web page by using linked HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 

However, to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts, I had use jQuery and JavaScript to load the data from the NMA API. This initially was difficult. However, through re-reading the module 1 & 2 course content, watching LinkedIn tutorials and getting support from faculty members, I was able to grasp the concepts. 

To make the web application responsive there are two main function components that use getJSON to return data. 
Firstly, there is a search bar located on the top right corner of the website. This search bar uses a var query and getData function to return data that mentions the searched word. 
Secondly, there is four different subcategories of jewellery that are text-links which are located on the home page. When these are clicked, they return data that mentions the clicked word.

The data returned was based on the tags that I requested through my HTML and jQuery. The types I believed were relevant to my theme of Jewellery were; title, object type, material and physical description. 

The last stage was to stylise the web application to show the data in a dynamic way. I chose a background of gemstones as they are often seen in jewellery pieces. I then used columns to display the data so that it was easy to read. The inspiration for colour theme came from the hero image of the gemstones. 
  
Conclusion

Through utilising the concepts learnt through modules 1 & 2 of this unit, I was able to create a responsive web application that displayed dynamic data informed from a GLAM API. My web application, is relatively simple, however demonstrates an understanding. In the future, I would like to continue to work on this web application, so that it could return images related to the objects.
